## Personal Portfolio Website

This website is my personal portfolio. It contains some information about me,
ways to contact me, and links to my GitHub projects.

The terminal is entirely my work. It is a simple javascript application that uses 
the jQuery library to simulate a UN\*X terminal.

I used iFrames to bring together a bunch of different cool portfolio elements
that I found. Some of the code is mine, some is borrowed. Everyone whose code I
used is acknowledged below.
